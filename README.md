BMI CALCULATOR 
BMI Calculator (Python)
This project is a simple Body Mass Index calculator made using basic Python ideas. It is designed in an easy way so first year students can understand how to use functions, lists and simple if-else logic. The goal is to calculate BMI for different people and show their health status.
Problem Definition
Many people want to check if their weight is healthy, but they don't always know how BMI is counted. So this program makes a small tool that can calculate BMI using weight and height, and then show if a person is underweight, normal, overweight or obese. It is a simple problem but helps to learn program design.
Requirement Analysis
The program should be able to:
•	take a person's weight
•	take height in meters
•	calculate BMI
•	decide the BMI category
•	print a small report for each person
•	handle multiple people using lists
Top Down Design / Modularization
The program is broken into small functions so it is easier to manage:
1.	Function to calculate BMI
2.	Function to check BMI category
3.	Function to print the report
4.	Lists to store names, weights and heights
5.	A loop to process each person one by one
This design keeps everything simple and clean for learning.
Algorithm Development (Short Explanation)
1.	Start program
2.	For each person:
o	read weight and height
o	calculate BMI
o	find the BMI category
o	print the result report
3.	Move to next person
4.	End program
Implementation
The project uses:
•	basic Python functions
•	lists for storing data
•	a for-loop to handle multiple entries
•	simple arithmetic (height * height)
•	print statements for output
Testing and Refinement
The code was tested with:
•	different weight values
•	tall and short people
•	underweight and overweight cases
The results were checked manually with online BMI calculators to see if values are correct.
Expected Outcome
The program will:
•	print BMI for each person
•	show the correct health category
•	be easy to understand for beginners
•	work fast and can be improved later if needed
